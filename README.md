# Anonymous-voting-tool
This tool used html, php, mysql, and python. This tool needs a csv file containing voter's emails as an input. Than each of voters will get an random code called "vote code". By typing voter's vote code and choose on html website, the respond will be send to mysql where you can use *SELECT function to see result without really knowing voter's names.  You can also delete mailing record to be absolutely fair.
